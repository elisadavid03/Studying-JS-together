# Key Points to Remember

**Condition**: An expression that evaluates to true or false.

**Block of Code**: Statements enclosed within curly braces {} that execute if the condition is true.

**Else**: Optional block of code that executes if the condition is false (for if-else and else-if statements).

**Switch**: Used for multi-way branching based on the value of an expression.

# Summary

Conditionals are essential for writing logic-driven programs in JavaScript. They allow you to control the flow of execution based on different conditions, making your code more flexible and responsive to different scenarios. Understanding how to use if, if-else, else-if, and switch statements effectively enables you to build complex decision-making processes in your JavaScript applications.
