Arithmetic operators perform arithmetic operations on numeric operands.

- **Addition (+)**: Adds two operands.

  `let sum = 5 + 3;  // sum is 8`

- **Subtraction (-)**: Subtracts the second operand from the first.

  `let difference = 10 - 4;  // difference is 6`

- **Multiplication (\*)**: Multiplies two operands.

  `let product = 3 \* 4;  // product is 12`

- **Division (/)**: Divides the first operand by the second.

  `let quotient = 20 / 5;  // quotient is 4`

- **Modulus (%)**: Returns the remainder of a division operation.

  `let remainder = 15 % 4;  // remainder is 3`
