Assignment operators assign values to variables.


- **Assignment (=)**: Assigns a value to a variable.

`let x = 10`;


- **Addition Assignment (+=)**: Adds the value on the right to the variable on the left and assigns the result to the variable on the left.

`let y = 5; y += 3;  // equivalent to y = y + 3; (y is now 8)`


- **Subtraction Assignment (-=)**: Subtracts the value on the right from the variable on the left and assigns the result to the variable on the left.

```javascript
let z = 10;

z -= 4;  // equivalent to z = z - 4; (z is now 6)
