Unary operators operate on a single operand.

- **Unary plus (+)**: Attempts to convert an operand into a number.

`let number = +'5';   // number is 5 (converted from string to number)`

- **Unary minus (-)**: Negates an operand.

`let negNumber = -5;  // negNumber is -5`

- **Increment (++) and Decrement (--)**: Increase or decrease the value of a variable by 1.

```javascript
let count = 0;

count++;   // count is now 1
