**True or False?**

Variables declared with **let** reveal their value only once.

True

False

Correctness: **False**.

- Variables declared with **let** do not reveal their value only once. Once a variable is declared with let, its value can be accessed and updated multiple times throughout the execution of the program, as long as you are within the scope where the variable is defined.

Here's an example to illustrate this:

`let num = 1;`

`console.log(num);  // Output: 1`


`num = 2;`

`console.log(num);  // Output: 2`


`num = 3;`

`console.log(num);  // Output: 3`

- In this example, num is declared with let and its value is printed three times (1, 2, and 3) as it is updated. This demonstrates that variables declared with let can have their values accessed and changed multiple times during the program's execution.
