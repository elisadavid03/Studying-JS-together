You can always access a variable anywhere in your code as long as you declare it with let.

Correctness: **Incorrect**.

- **Explanation**: Variables declared with let (and const) are scoped to the block in which they are declared (block-scoped). This means you can only access them within the block they are defined in or within nested blocks.
  For example:

if (true) {


    let localVar = 'inside block';

    console.log(localVar);  // 'inside block' - localVar is accessible here

}

console.log(localVar);  // ReferenceError: localVar is not defined


Outside of the block where localVar is declared, it is not accessible. This scoping ensures that variables are kept within their intended scope, improving code clarity and preventing accidental modification from outside contexts.
