- You can redeclare a variable called test if it was declared with let the first time.

Correctness: Incorrect.

- Explanation: In JavaScript, if you declare a variable using let, you cannot redeclare it within the same scope. Attempting to do so will result in a syntax error. For example:

let test = 1;

let test = 2;  // SyntaxError: Identifier 'test' has already been declared

Therefore, you cannot redeclare a variable with let once it has already been declared in that scope.
